PreRequisites
-------------

1. You should have Perl installed. Most of the linux distributions has it by default.
2. Nothing special: Basic commands like, find, md5sum are used in the code. It is expected to be available 
in the default path. You dont have to do anything special for this, in normal linux systems it is 
supposed to be available by default.

Notes 
-----
1. To get familiarity with the find command, read my article at www.thegeekstuff.com

	http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2009/06/15-practical-unix-linux-find-command-examples-part-2/
2. To find out the size of a block, use tune2fs command as mentioned below.

Known Issues
------------
1. If you have different block size across file system, then this utility will not work as expected.
2. For file content duplication: md5 is calculated using md5sum command, though it is costly to do md5sum command invocation ( new process for each file ), i used it for the time being.
3. You may get Permission denied errors, if you dont have permission with the directories / files.
4. Options has to be given separately ( as -n -s ). You cannot concatenate options as ( -ns ).
